### Questionnaire:

2. Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
3. If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
4. What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation
