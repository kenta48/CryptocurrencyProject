# CryptocurrencyProject
Website to compare two cryptocurrency prices(BTC&amp;ETH) at the two different exchanges

## instructions on how to build and run
If using the terminal, type <code>python3 -m http.server</code> in that directory
Personally, I used the VScode to build and used “live server” that is part of Visual Studio Code
### Questionnaire:
1. Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?
2. Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
3. If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
4. What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation
